Hi, I'm Reoseah, I do a lot of things but mostly Minecraft mods.

## Mods

### Catwalks, Inc.

Catwalks, Inc. is my most downloaded mod so far. It adds, as the name suggests, catwalks, like the ones you may see in factories and other industrial settings.

Two main ideas I had for this mod, are:
- flat "textures" instead of voxels, which better fits into vanilla aesthetics
- simple blocks that automatically connect and form stairs or ladders when needed

### Tree Hollows

Tree Hollows is a rather simple mod that adds "Hollow" block for each vanilla log and spawns it in world with random loot, sticks, seeds and feathers most of the time.

### Industrial Craft 2

I joined IC2 team in January 2022 to help with updating the mod to new Minecraft versions. I updated many textures to match new Minecraft style and ported some things to 1.17, and then 1.18 and then... You can check whatever state the mod is right now on [IC2 Jenkins](https://jenkins.ic2.player.to/job/IC2/).

I also did [small addon for IC2](https://forum.industrial-craft.net/thread/13070-1-9-4-reinforcement) long time ago. It added blocks young me found useful or missing: panes for Reinforced Glass, Reinforced Trapdoors, Tiles and Cracked variants for Reinforced Stone. I also allowed the textures to be used in IC2 Classic later.

### Lacrimis

Lacrimis is a mod I, 2xsaiko, stuin, amo and Chriss made for [Modfest 1.16](https://legacy.modfest.net/1.16/), where it actually took Theme Award in Magic Category. It didn't get much love after that, however.
